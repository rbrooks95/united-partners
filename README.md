#### The source code for the PHP series "Learn PHP The Right Way".

This repository will contain the code related to specific lessons/videos separated by branches. For example, if you watched lesson 1.31 then you should switch to branch 1.31 to find the appropriate code for it. Each lesson that has an exercise or a mini project or some sort of related code, it will be available in the branch named after the lesson number. Note that not all lessons have associated code changes, so if a branch is missing for some lessons it simply means that there were no significant code changes in that lesson.

The final project of this series is under a separate repository: https://github.com/ggelashvili/expennies which is for the section P.
